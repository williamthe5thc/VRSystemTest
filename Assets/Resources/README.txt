VR Interview System Resources Directory

This directory contains resources used by the VR Interview System at runtime, including:

- AnimatorControllers for the avatar
- Default configurations
- Scene data

The directory is automatically created by the VRInterviewMenuItems.cs script
when setting up the system. If you're seeing this file, the setup has run successfully.

To create a new animator controller, use the "VR Interview > Create Animator Controller" menu option.
