## Known Issues

1. **Animation System**
   - Some animation transitions can be abrupt between states
   - VRM blend shape synchronization can lag in certain conditions
   - Gesture animations need more randomization for natural appearance
   - Face and body animations need better coordination

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Avatar blend shapes can cause performance drops on Quest
   - Audio processing consumes significant CPU resources
   - Scene loading causes temporary frame drops
   - Memory usage grows over time during long sessions

3. **Integration Issues**
   - Animation events sometimes don't trigger reliably
   - Lip sync accuracy varies with different audio content
   - Facial expressions on VRM models need calibration
   - Animation layer weights need optimization

## Next Steps
