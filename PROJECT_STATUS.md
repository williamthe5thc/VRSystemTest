# VR Interview System - Project Status

## Issues Fixed

1. **SessionManager Instance**
   - Added static Instance property to SessionManager for global access
   - Fixed Awake/Start methods to properly initialize the singleton

2. **Coroutine Issues in try/catch Blocks**
   - Fixed FacialExpressions.cs - Restructured all coroutines to avoid yields in try/catch blocks
   - Fixed AudioPlayback.cs - Moved try/catch outside of the yield sections

3. **Missing MenuController Methods**
   - Added ShowInterviewMenu method to MenuController

4. **SettingsManager Integration**
   - Updated references to non-existent SettingsManager methods to use the generic GetSetting/SetSetting pattern
   - Fixed method calls in MenuController.cs

5. **Async/Await Warnings**
   - Added proper await keywords to async method calls in:
     - AppManager.cs
     - ConnectionManager.cs
     - WebSocketClient.cs

6. **WebSocketCloseCode Conflicts**
   - Marked the conflicting WebSocketCloseCodeDefinition.cs file for deletion
   - This file should be manually deleted in Unity to resolve conflicts with the installed NativeWebSocket package

7. **XR Dependencies**
   - Updated VRRigSetup.cs to use more generic approach without specific XR type dependencies
   - Added conditional compilation with #if UNITY_XR_MANAGEMENT for XR-specific imports

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Create Unity Scenes**
   - Create MainMenu.unity in the Scenes folder
   - Create environment scenes in Scenes/Environments folder:
     - CorporateOffice.unity
     - StartupOffice.unity
     - CasualOffice.unity

2. **Delete Conflicting Files**
   - Delete WebSocketCloseCodeDefinition.cs and its .meta file

3. **Configure XR Plugin Management**
   - Open Project Settings > XR Plugin Management
   - Enable Oculus in the Android tab

4. **Configure InputSystem**
   - Go to Project Settings > Player
   - Set "Active Input Handling" to "Both" or "Input System Package"

5. **Create Basic Prefabs**
   - Create prefabs for:
     - XR Rig
     - Avatar
     - UI Elements
     - Loading Screen
     - Core Systems

6. **Configure Android Build Settings**
   - Set minimum API level to Android 10 (API level 29)
   - Set Graphics APIs to Vulkan or OpenGLES3
   - Configure package name and other Android settings

## Next Steps for Development

1. **Basic Scene Setup**
   - Set up a simple test scene with an avatar and UI elements
   - Test WebSocket connection to your Python server
   - Verify audio capture and playback

2. **UI Development**
   - Create main menu UI with environment and avatar selection
   - Implement in-interview UI elements (state indicators, feedback UI)
   - Add debug UI for development purposes

3. **Avatar Implementation**
   - Import or create avatar models with blend shapes
   - Configure animation controller with necessary states
   - Set up lip-sync system

4. **Environment Creation**
   - Create or import 3D models for interview environments
   - Set up lighting and materials
   - Add interactive elements

5. **Integration Testing**
   - Test complete flow from menu to interview
   - Verify all state transitions
   - Test on actual Oculus Quest hardware

6. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile performance on Quest
   - Optimize rendering and scripts
   - Implement LOD (Level of Detail) where needed

## Known Issues

1. **Android SDK Issue**
   - The console shows warnings about Android SDK XML version mismatch
   - This is likely due to different versions of Android Studio and command line tools
   - This should not affect the core functionality of the project

2. **Missing Await Warnings**
   - Some warnings about missing await operators remain in:
     - VRInteractionUI.cs
     - SessionManager.cs
   - These should be addressed as part of the UI development phase

3. **Unused Fields Warnings**
   - Several warnings about fields being assigned but never used
   - These can be addressed during code cleanup phase
